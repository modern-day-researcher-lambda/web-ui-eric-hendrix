Product/App name: Research Pal

"Pitch: I have a problem and it's resource links shared to articles that my wife wants me to read. I need a place where I can organize that chaos. Enter, Research Pal! The place where all articles, blog posts can be shared, categorized and shown in a beautiful interface.

MVP: As a user I can log in and see a list of links that have been shared with me. As I user I can click on categories tabs to filter links so that I have some organization in my life. As a user I can create and share my own links with other users. As a User I can check a link as ""done"" after I've finished reading the article. 

Stretch Goal: Make it social. Design a way to allow users to ""friend"" one another and see a list of items that friends have shared with others. "

**This website uses sass for styling.**
Installing sass: 
----------------
    npm install -g sass

Using sass:
-----------
    You can also watch individual files or directories with the --watch flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. If you wanted to watch (instead of manually build) your input.scss file, you'd just add the watch flag to your command, like so:

    **sass --watch input.scss output.css**
    You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this example:

    **sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets**
    Sass would watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder.
