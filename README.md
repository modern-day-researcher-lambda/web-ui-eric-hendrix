Product/App name: Research Pal

"Pitch: I have a problem and it's resource links shared to articles that my wife wants me to read. I need a place where I can organize that chaos. Enter, Research Pal! The place where all articles, blog posts can be shared, categorized and shown in a beautiful interface.

MVP: As a user I can log in and see a list of links that have been shared with me. As I user I can click on categories tabs to filter links so that I have some organization in my life. As a user I can create and share my own links with other users. As a User I can check a link as ""done"" after I've finished reading the article. 

Stretch Goal: Make it social. Design a way to allow users to ""friend"" one another and see a list of items that friends have shared with others. "
